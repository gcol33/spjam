\title{Decompose Spatial Structure into Components}
\usage{
scatter_decomposition(fit, locations = NULL, summary = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{A \code{spjam_fit} object.}

\item{locations}{Optional matrix or sf object of locations at which to
compute the decomposition. Default uses observation locations.}

\item{summary}{Logical. If TRUE (default), returns posterior summaries.
If FALSE, returns full posterior draws.}
}
\value{
A \code{spjam_decomposition} object containing:
\item{ecological}{Spatial structure attributable to ecology only}
\item{sampling}{Spatial structure attributable to sampling only}
\item{shared}{Shared structure (the confounding)}
\item{variance_partition}{Proportion of variance in each component}
\item{coupling}{Posterior for beta_share}
}
\description{
Decomposes the fitted spatial surface into ecological-only, sampling-only,
and shared components. This is the primary diagnostic for understanding
how much spatial structure is attributable to preferential sampling.
