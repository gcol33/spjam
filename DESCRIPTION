Description: A Bayesian spatial modelling pipeline that separates ecological
    signal from sampling-driven scatter under preferential sampling. Implements
    joint hierarchical models where sampling locations and ecological processes
    are estimated simultaneously with shared latent spatial structure, producing
    sampling-adjusted predictions that reflect where ecological processes occur
    rather than where observers look.
